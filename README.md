This project is a react movie app, here is a breakdown of somethings that i used: 

1. Used a real api to search for these movies while we type
2. Created a grid display of the movies 
3. Add movies to and remove them from our favourites
4. Save our favourites to local storage to they appear when the app refreshes

So i used the OMDB API as the source for our movies, yes this API is free to use all we need to do is to signup to get the API key that would be used.\
